This is a simple test bank application built using JWT for user authentication, It was built using-

Reactjs/html/css on front end;
Nodejs, Expressjs, Mongodb, with client mongoose

Refresh tokens are not enabled on this test app therefore authentication will be lost on page refresh

To preserve the statelessness of the REST APIs, they've been made all accessible and are not bound to JWT auth
